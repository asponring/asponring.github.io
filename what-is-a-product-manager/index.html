    <section class="post">
      <p>As I mentioned in my earlier posts, I had been a product manager for many years before deciding to pursue engineering. A few weeks ago at Hack Reactor, I gave a short presentation to my classmates about what a PM does and how they interact with engineers. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qLnRhF6zI03plrELM3ejl2hI-zclg9SufoShUjqugS0/edit?usp=sharing">You can find that presentation here.</a></p>

<p>A number of classmates told me they found the presentation valuable so I thought I'd go over some of it here. I feel it's especially valuable for someone new to the tech industry, as there's not a lot of general knowledge about what a PM is.</p>

<p>My definition of a product manager (and this definition is shaped by my 5+ years in the industry rather than formal education in it) is that a PM is the person who defines the features of a product and drives their development. Ultimately, a PM's thought process can be summarized in the Venn diagram below. The PM has to approach his product from 3 different but overlapping perspectives: those of the customer, the technology, and the business.</p>

<p><img src="http://andysponring.com/content/images/2015/05/pm-questions.png" alt="Questions a PM must ask" /></p>

<p>Along with those perspectives come the key questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Customer perspective:</strong> What should we build? (Or for an existing product: how do we make customers love our product even more?)</li>
<li><strong>Technology perspective:</strong> How do we build it?</li>
<li><strong>Business perspective:</strong> How do we measure its success? ("Money" is the most common answer, but not always.)</li>
</ul>

<p>One point I didn't cover in the slides is that PMs are involved in the entire lifecycle of a product. In my experience, the PM's involvement at each step has been this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Requirements gathering - researching customer needs, assessing market conditions (what are competitors doing?). Then synthesizing these learnings into a concrete product plan - how will this product address the customers' problems?  </li>
<li>Defining metrics for success - is it a certain amount of daily revenue? daily active users? retetion? Will users be more likely to invite their friends to the product afterward?  </li>
<li>Sprint planning - sitting with engineers, going over requirements, and getting time estimates for each item. Drawing up a realistic schedule while pushing hard if need be to ship earlier  </li>
<li>Answering questions and resolving blockers for engineers during sprint  </li>
<li>Final review and go-ahead for any product or product feature before it's shipped  </li>
<li>Reviewing product performance and determining if metrics for success were met</li>
</ol>

<p>Ideally all these steps can be completed in as short of a time frame as possible and the process can start all over with the learnings from the last development cycle. Often, things will happen in parallel. While engineers are actively developing a feature I defined, I'll be hard at work analyzing the metrics for a feature we previously shipped and drawing up a product plan for what we'll do in the next sprint. </p>

<p>There's much more I could discuss but I think what I described here and in my slides gives some insight into what I used to do. In future posts I plan to cover practical tips for how engineers can deal with their PMs and as well as my thoughts on whether you should pursue product management as a career.</p>
