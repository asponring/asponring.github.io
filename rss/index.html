<p>Why make the transition?</p>

<p>Quite simply, I love to code. While working as a product manager, my favorite part of the job was always the time I spent with my engineers, whether it was discussing specs, reviewing the work they did, or just conversing about the issues they faced and how they solved them.</p>

<p>Though I didn't start out with a formal CS degree, I built up my programming skills after work and on weekends. I started small with some online tutorials, then I took actual computer science classes. Last year, I decided to make engineering the focus of my career.</p>

<p>Coding bootcamps have been getting a <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/12/20/370954988/twelve-weeks-to-a-six-figure-job">lot of press</a> and seemed like a natural fit for me, since they put students through an accelerated course of study that is 100% focused on preparing them for the industry. <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a> has certainly distinguished itself as one of the <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/blog/industry-rankings-place-hack-reactor-as-top-school-in-the-world">best bootcamps out there</a>. </p>

<p>The program lasts 13 weeks, 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. At the end of the three months, graduates are fluent in full stack web development, but more importantly, have enough skills and experience to solve any technical problem that comes their way, and to master any new technology they need.</p>

<p>I'm just starting my 3rd week here and I'm loving it. I'll be updating this blog with my experiences, interesting tidbits I learn, challenges I overcome, and more stuff about myself. I hope you'll join me on this journey!</p>]]></description><link>http://andysponring.com/journey-to-hack-reactor/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">861f1d7e-a0d3-4be1-9de6-651a77f1a1a1</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andy Sponring]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2015 05:04:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Story Thus Far]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://andysponring.com/content/images/2015/04/Amazing-Austria---Imgur.jpg" alt="The Story Thus Far"><p>Hey everyone! My name is Andy and I’m a product manager turned software engineer. For the last 5 years I've worked at various startups in the Silicon Valley, mostly doing social and mobile games.</p>

<p>The next leg of my journey is a 12 week immersive program called <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor</a>. Staring March 23, I’ll be there 6 days a week for 12 hours a day, learning full-stack web development, algorithms, data structures, and a bunch of other fun, useful stuff. </p>

<p>Here’s my story in a few bullets:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bay Area native (grew up in Mountain View, CA)</li>
<li>Graduated UC Berkeley in 2007</li>
<li>Joined a startup called Playdom in 2008 as one of the first 10 employees</li>
<li>Playdom was acquired by Disney in 2010</li>
<li>Left Disney in 2012 and then worked for a couple startups</li>
<li>Got married to the love of my life just a few months ago!</li>
