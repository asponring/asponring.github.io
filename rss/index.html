The formal definition requires that the empty set as well as S itself be included in the power set.</p>

<p>As a part of an exercise the other week, I wrote an algorithm for finding power set, where the input was actually a string and the output was an array of strings containing subsets of the characters in the input string (so the input string "abc" would yield [ '' , 'a', 'b', 'c', 'ab', 'ac', 'bc', 'abc' ]). While my solution followed a common pattern for finding subset, it wasn't until I learned a little more about set theory that I discovered a completely different approach that is quite interesting. I wanted to share this approach and a modified algorithm in this blog post.</p>

<p>The first and more straightforward algorithm that I employed looks like this (pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>Given set S as input  
Let C be a collection which will contain our power set  
Add the empty set to C  
For element x in S  
    For set y in C
        Add the set y + x to C
</code></pre>

<p>While this algo works perfectly fine, the solution I'm about to describe using binary numbers may prove more pedagogically useful as it gives a deeper understanding of power set.</p>

<p>Let's say the string "abc" is our input. We can think of "abc" as a number in base 2, where each digit is set to 1.</p>

<pre><code>a b c  
1 1 1  
</code></pre>

<p>When we create a subset of "abc" what we are really doing is switching one or more digits of that number to 0. Switching a digit to 0 is akin to removing that element from the set. Here's a couple examples:</p>

<pre><code>a b c  
1 0 1  
=&gt; "ac"

a b c  
0 1 1  
=&gt; "bc"
</code></pre>

<p>So the act of producing a power set can be thought of counting from 0 until 2^n - 1, where n is the number of elements in the input set. Why is this? Firstly, imagine that we are counting in binary. Starting at 0, no elements of set S will be included. In other words, this is the empty set.</p>

<pre><code>a b c  
0 0 0  
=&gt; ""
</code></pre>

<p>As we count upwards, we will naturally go through all the combinations of zeroes and ones until all digits equal 1, translating into the original set itself. For a set of 3, the final binary number will be "111", or 2^n - 1. At this point, counting the empty set, we have 8 elements, or 2^n. </p>

<p>It so happens that, by definition, the power set of set S with n elements is exactly 2^n (hence the term "<em>power</em> set").</p>

<p>I decided to start from scratch and write an algorithm that uses bitwise operations to calculate power set. I chose to write it in Java since Java's bitwise operations are close to the hardware and faster than in, say, <a href="http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/javascript/excerpts/javascript-good-parts/bad-parts.html">JavaScript</a>.</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.Arrays;  
import java.lang.Math;

public class PowerSet  
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      System.out.println(Arrays.toString(findPowerSet("abc")));
      System.out.println(Arrays.toString(findPowerSet("power")));
   }

   public static String[] findPowerSet(String input)
   {
      // Assume the input has no duplicate characters for simplicity
      int inputLength = input.length();
      int powerSetSize = (int)Math.pow(2, inputLength);
      String[] result = new String[powerSetSize];

      for (int k = 0; k &lt; powerSetSize; k++) 
      {
         String set = "";
         int binaryDigits = k;
         for (int j = 0; j &lt; inputLength; j++)
         {
            if (binaryDigits % 2 == 1)
               set += input.charAt(j);
            binaryDigits &gt;&gt;= 1;
         }
         result[k] = set;
      }

      return result;
   }
}

/* console output:
 * [, a, b, ab, c, ac, bc, abc]
 * [, p, o, po, w, pw, ow, pow, e, pe, oe, poe, we, pwe, owe, powe, r, pr, or, por, wr, pwr, owr, powr, er, per, oer, poer, wer, pwer, ower, power]
 */
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the results are exactly as expected.</p>

<p>One drawback of this new algorithm is its slower run time compared with the original. Whereas my first algo had a time complexity of O(2^n), the new algorithm has O(n * 2^n). The difference comes from how many times we iterate. In the first algo we only needed as many iterations as there were elements in the power set. In the second implementation, I have an outer loop counting from 0 to 2^n, and an inner loop within that going from 0 to n (or O(n) time complexity). The inner loop is necessary to find out each binary digit within the current iteration count. This latter operation is done using the right bitshift operator (">>"), which if you don't know about, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op3.html">you should totally read up on</a> because it's awesome. Basically, the bitshift allows me to go through each digit of a binary number and test if that digit is 0 or 1 (using modulo 2).</p>

<p>By the way, in case you were wondering (and I was), O(n * 2^n) does NOT reduce to O(2^n).

A few weeks ago at Hack Reactor, I gave a short presentation to my classmates about what a PM does and how they interact with engineers. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qLnRhF6zI03plrELM3ejl2hI-zclg9SufoShUjqugS0/edit?usp=sharing">You can find that presentation here.</a></p>

<p>A number of classmates told me they found the presentation valuable so I thought I'd go over some of it here. I feel it's especially valuable for someone new to the tech industry, as there's not a lot of general knowledge about what a PM is.</p>

<p>My definition of a product manager (and this definition is shaped by my 5+ years in the industry rather than formal education in it) is that a PM is the person who defines the features of a product and drives their development. Ultimately, a PM's thought process can be summarized in the Venn diagram below. The PM has to approach his product from 3 different but overlapping perspectives: those of the customer, the technology, and the business.</p>

<p><img src="http://andysponring.com/content/images/2015/05/pm-questions.png" alt="Questions a PM must ask"></p>

<p>Along with those perspectives come the key questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Customer perspective:</strong> What should we build? (Or for an existing product: how do we make customers love our product even more?)</li>
<li><strong>Technology perspective:</strong> How do we build it?</li>
<li><strong>Business perspective:</strong> How do we measure its success? ("Money" is the most common answer, but not always.)</li>
</ul>

<p>One point I didn't cover in the slides is that PMs are involved in the entire lifecycle of a product. In my experience, the PM's involvement at each step has been this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Requirements gathering - researching customer needs, assessing market conditions (what are competitors doing?). Then synthesizing these learnings into a concrete product plan - how will this product address the customers' problems?  </li>
<li>Defining metrics for success - is it a certain amount of daily revenue? daily active users? retetion? Will users be more likely to invite their friends to the product afterward?  </li>
<li>Sprint planning - sitting with engineers, going over requirements, and getting time estimates for each item. Drawing up a realistic schedule while pushing hard if need be to ship earlier  </li>
<li>Answering questions and resolving blockers for engineers during sprint  </li>
<li>Final review and go-ahead for any product or product feature before it's shipped  </li>
<li>Reviewing product performance and determining if metrics for success were met</li>
</ol>

<p>Ideally all these steps can be completed in as short of a time frame as possible and the process can start all over with the learnings from the last development cycle. Often, things will happen in parallel. While engineers are actively developing a feature I defined, I'll be hard at work analyzing the metrics for a feature we previously shipped and drawing up a product plan for what we'll do in the next sprint. </p>

<p>There's much more I could discuss but I think what I described here and in my slides gives some insight into what I used to do. In future posts I plan to cover practical tips for how engineers can deal with their PMs and as well as my thoughts on whether you should pursue product management as a career.</p>]]></description><link>http://andysponring.com/what-is-a-product-manager/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5664c4a2-9c6e-4a12-bb32-53bcf2c6b8fd</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andy Sponring]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2015 21:08:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Applying to Hack Reactor]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>The stat that <a href="http://qr.ae/LZ55P">Hack Reactor accepts only about 1 in 30 applicants</a> is still true, and now that I'm here I've seen how many technical interviews end unfavorably for candidates. Athough there are already numerous posts out there about the Hack Reactor admissions process, I thought I'd add my personal story here in the hopes that it might help people decide whether to apply, and if so, how to prepare.</p>

<p>Note: this all occured in November of 2014, and HR constantly iterates on their admissions process, so anything I write here could soon be outdated.</p>

<p>The first step of applying was solving a very basic coding challenge on the Hack Reactor website. I won't go into specifics, but it is so simple that even with no prior knowledge of JavaScript syntax, you should be able to crank out an answer after a couple minutes of Googling.</p>

<p>Immediately after completing this challenge, I was invited to sign up for a technical interview. The interview could take place in person or over Skype. Since I was already living in San Francisco, I opted for in person. Scheduling your interview is a self-service process, involving Google Calendar. I secured a spot a week and a half away.</p>

<p>A few things surprised me about the interview. Firstly, there seemed to be a low bar to getting the interview (just that basic admissions challenge). But perhaps that challenge proves effective at weeding out the majority of candidates who aren't really serious about applying. </p>

<p>The next surprised came when I reached Hack Reactor for my interview. Rather than happening in a private office, my interview was conducted entirely in the open on the office floor. This was a shock, and I chalk it up to office space being a premium at HR. In any case, don't let it throw you off. Be prepared to tune out the noise of the surrounding office activity.</p>

<p>My biggest surprise of all, however, was that it was a purely technical interview. As a product manager, I had been used to conducting interviews that included a mix of both "soft" questions (personality, background, management style) and "hard" questions (analyzing data, discussing monetization tactics, etc). My interviewer was genuinely surprised when I opened by handing him my meticulously prepared resume. "We're not big on resumes," he explained, but gave it a courtesy glance anyway. No further questions about my background were asked, and we launched right away into coding.</p>

<p>My interviewer and I shared a workstation with only a text editor open. I can't say much about the tasks I was given, but suffice to say they were challenging and not beginner programming tasks. That said, it appears that candidates aren't expected to absolutely nail the challenges. What's more important is for the interviewer to see how you work through solving a difficult problem, how you communicate your ideas, and how well you work under pressure.</p>

<p>Of course, I didn't have the advantage of this perspective while in the interview, and came away unsure what the outcome would be. Although I had solved most of the challenges, a couple had stumped me. I got the good news a week and a half later and eagerly accepted.</p>

<p>Finally, for prospective applicants I want to call out 3 resources that were exceptionally helpful to me in applying. If you're coming in with no programming experience, these are a must:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript">Codecademy's Javascript Track</a> - an easy primer to the world of programming using JavaScript</li>
<li><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent Javascript</a> - <em>especially</em> chapters 1-5. Absolutely key to a deeper understanding of JS</li>
<li><a href="http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges/">Coderbyte challenges</a> - these are small challenges similar to the ones you'll get in your HR interview. Do as many of the easy challenges as you can and some of the medium. These types of problems are common interview questions in the industry as well</li>

<p>When I downloaded <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, all I got were the raw files that scaffold out a blog. But hosting and serving up the blog content was left up to me, the user. </p>

<p>In this short post I just want to call out 2 helpful guides I used to make this blog possible. After reading these posts I was convinced that hosting the blog on Github pages was the best option for me. The two main advantages for me were:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's free!  </li>
<li>Pushing updates was as simple as doing a git push to my GitHub Page repository.</li>
</ol>

<p>To get started yourself read the 2 following posts (in order - the first one will at some point direct you to the 2nd one for further instructions):</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://irruncibly.so/how-to-make-a-blog-for-free/">How to make a blog for free</a> - written by a fellow Hack Reactor student  </li>
<li><a href="http://ledtechnica.com/free-ghost-hosting-on-github-pages/">Free Ghost Hosting on Github Pages</a></li>
</ol>

<p>While these guides taken together are really robust, I wanted to make two addenda. I advise reading the following only after you've gone through the guides above.</p>

<h3 id="howtoupdateyourblog">How to update your blog</h3>

<p>You'll probably want to push new posts live regularly. Here's how:</p>

<ol>
<li>Publish your new post or site changes to localhost.  </li>
<li>From the command line, <strong>cd</strong> into the directory that contains your "static" folder  </li>
<li>Again run <strong>buster generate --domain=<a href="http://127.0.0.1:2368">http://127.0.0.1:2368</a></strong>. Do NOT run this command from inside the "static" folder, as that will create yet ANOTHER static folder inside there (I made this mistake)  </li>
<li>Now <strong>cd</strong> into "static" and <strong>git commit</strong> and push up your changes to GitHub. The changes should be online shortly.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="howtoaddstaticpages">How to add static pages</h3>

<p>You might already have added one or two static pages to your site. For instance, clicking <a href="http://andysponring.com/about">About</a> on that sidebar will take you to one. You can create these in ghost by clicking the settings icon next to "Save Draft" when authoring a post, then selecting "Turn this post into a static page".</p>

<p><img src="http://andysponring.com/content/images/2015/04/staticpage.png" alt="How to create a static page"></p>

<p>The Buster tool that is referenced in the how-to guides doesn't play nice with static pages unfortunately. It will add them to your static folder without the ".html" extension, causing them not to appear when linked to in your live blog.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> after running <strong>buster generate --domain=<a href="http://127.0.0.1:2368">http://127.0.0.1:2368</a></strong>, look for the file containing your static page in the "static" folder. Add ".html" to the filename, <strong>and also make sure to delete an older version of the page</strong> if there is one. Once you change the file extension, Buster doesn't recognize it anymore and generates a new version of the static page each time, rather than merging changes with the previous version.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in my experience and with the theme I'm using, I've have to repeat the above steps with my static page each time I update my blog, even if I didn't make changes to the static page.</p>

<p>Once you've added the file extension and deleted the old version, you're all set and can push the changes to GitHub!</p>]]></description><link>http://andysponring.com/using-github-pages-to-host-your-blog-for-free/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">240bf4f3-0c14-4b34-846b-da3573640916</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andy Sponring]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2015 21:27:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[About Ghost]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This blog is made with <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, an open source blogging platform. All the hosting is done (for free!) through GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>There was some discussion amongst my Hack Reactor cohort-mates as to which platform was best for building a blog. Honestly, before my programmer days, setting up a blog (to me) seemed like a very simple task. Dozens of free services exist, like Wordpress, Blogger, or Tumblr. So I was surprised that most of my classmates chose Ghost. </p>

<p>Having gone with Ghost (which is arguably the harder option), I can speak to some pros and cons of using it. </p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Really flexible: you have access to all the source code to the blog internals and can modify it as much as you want</li>
<li>Lightweight: Ghost has pared down blog functionality to just the basics</li>
<li>Street cred: If you manage to get this all up and running you look awesome!</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons: </p>

<ul>
<li>Many free themes lack documentation, so you spend a lot of time tinkering to make things work</li>
<li>You have to host the blog yourself, or else pay Ghost (ie, the company behind Ghost) to host your blog</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I'm happy with my decision to use Ghost. I'll share the more technical details of how I did it in my next post.</p>

<p>Sidenote: I want to call out the current theme I'm using, <a href="https://github.com/Kikobeats/uno-zen">uno-zen</a>, and its creator, <a href="https://github.com/Kikobeats/uno-zen">Kiko Beats</a>. This was one of the best documented themes I found in the <a href="http://marketplace.ghost.org/themes/free/">Ghost marketplace</a>, which made setup much less of a headache than it could have been. I found a lot of free themes that provided almost no guidance, so it was refreshing to find an elegant theme that also had basic setup instructions.</p>]]></description><link>http://andysponring.com/about-ghost/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">eba4b6cd-2afa-40fa-8d10-07ea590ef8ed</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andy Sponring]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2015 16:09:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[My Journey to Hack Reactor]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://andysponring.com/content/images/2015/04/hrlogo.png" alt="My Journey to Hack Reactor"><p>I had been a product manager for about 5 years before I decided to take the plunge and do programming full time.</p>

<p>Why make the transition?</p>

<p>Quite simply, I love to code. While working as a product manager, my favorite part of the job was always the time I spent with my engineers, whether it was discussing specs, reviewing the work they did, or just conversing about the issues they faced and how they solved them.</p>

<p>Though I didn't start out with a formal CS degree, I built up my programming skills after work and on weekends. I started small with some online tutorials, then I took actual computer science classes. Last year, I decided to make engineering the focus of my career.</p>

<p>Coding bootcamps have been getting a <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/12/20/370954988/twelve-weeks-to-a-six-figure-job">lot of press</a> and seemed like a natural fit for me, since they put students through an accelerated course of study that is 100% focused on preparing them for the industry. <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a> has certainly distinguished itself as one of the <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/blog/industry-rankings-place-hack-reactor-as-top-school-in-the-world">best bootcamps out there</a>. </p>

<p>The program lasts 13 weeks, 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. At the end of the three months, graduates are fluent in full stack web development, but more importantly, have enough skills and experience to solve any technical problem that comes their way, and to master any new technology they need.</p>

<p>I'm just starting my 3rd week here and I'm loving it. I'll be updating this blog with my experiences, interesting tidbits I learn, challenges I overcome, and more stuff about myself. I hope you'll join me on this journey!</p>]]></description><link>http://andysponring.com/journey-to-hack-reactor/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">861f1d7e-a0d3-4be1-9de6-651a77f1a1a1</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andy Sponring]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2015 05:04:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Story Thus Far]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://andysponring.com/content/images/2015/04/Amazing-Austria---Imgur.jpg" alt="The Story Thus Far"><p>Hey everyone!
