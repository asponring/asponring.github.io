<p>When I downloaded <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, all I got were the raw files that scaffold out a blog. But hosting and serving up the blog content was left up to me, the user. </p>

<p>In this short post I just want to call out 2 helpful guides I used to make this blog possible. After reading these posts I was convinced that hosting the blog on Github pages was the best option for me. The two main advantages for me were:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's free!  </li>
<li>Pushing updates was as simple as doing a git push to my GitHub Page repository.</li>
</ol>

<p>To get started yourself read the 2 following posts (in order - the first one will at some point direct you to the 2nd one for further instructions):</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://irruncibly.so/how-to-make-a-blog-for-free/">How to make a blog for free</a> - written by a fellow Hack Reactor student  </li>
<li><a href="http://ledtechnica.com/free-ghost-hosting-on-github-pages/">Free Ghost Hosting on Github Pages</a></li>
</ol>

<p>While these guides taken together are really robust, I wanted to make two addenda. I advise reading the following only after you've gone through the guides above.</p>

<h3 id="howtoupdateyourblog">How to update your blog</h3>

<p>You'll probably want to push new posts live regularly. Here's how:</p>

<ol>
<li>Publish your new post or site changes to localhost.  </li>
<li>From the command line, <strong>cd</strong> into the directory that contains your "static" folder  </li>
<li>Again run <strong>buster generate --domain=<a href="http://127.0.0.1:2368">http://127.0.0.1:2368</a></strong>. Do NOT run this command from inside the "static" folder, as that will create yet ANOTHER static folder inside there (I made this mistake)  </li>
<li>Now <strong>cd</strong> into "static" and <strong>git commit</strong> and push up your changes to GitHub. The changes should be online shortly.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="howtoaddstaticpages">How to add static pages</h3>

<p>You might already have added one or two static pages to your site. For instance, clicking <a href="http://andysponring.com/about">About</a> on that sidebar will take you to one. You can create these in ghost by clicking the settings icon next to "Save Draft" when authoring a post, then selecting "Turn this post into a static page".</p>

<p><img src="http://andysponring.com/content/images/2015/04/staticpage.png" alt="How to create a static page"></p>

<p>The Buster tool that is referenced in the how-to guides doesn't play nice with static pages unfortunately. It will add them to your static folder without the ".html" extension, causing them not to appear when linked to in your live blog.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> after running <strong>buster generate --domain=<a href="http://127.0.0.1:2368">http://127.0.0.1:2368</a></strong>, look for the file containing your static page in the "static" folder. Add ".html" to the filename, <strong>and also make sure to delete an older version of the page</strong> if there is one. Once you change the file extension, Buster doesn't recognize it anymore and generates a new version of the static page each time, rather than merging changes with the previous version.</p>

<p>Note: you'll only need to follow the above steps after you either added a new static page or modified an existing one.</p>

<p>Once you've added the file extension and deleted the old version, you're all set and can push the changes to GitHub!</p>]]></description><link>http://andysponring.com/using-github-pages-to-host-your-blog-for-free/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">240bf4f3-0c14-4b34-846b-da3573640916</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andy Sponring]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2015 21:27:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[About Ghost]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This blog is made with <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, an open source blogging platform. All the hosting is done (for free!) through GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>There was some discussion amongst my Hack Reactor cohort-mates as to which platform was best for building a blog. Honestly, before my programmer days, setting up a blog (to me) seemed like a very simple task. Dozens of free services exist, like Wordpress, Blogger, or Tumblr. So I was surprised that most of my classmates chose Ghost. </p>

<p>Having gone with Ghost (which is arguably the harder option), I can speak to some pros and cons of using it. </p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Really flexible: you have access to all the source code to the blog internals and can modify it as much as you want</li>
<li>Lightweight: Ghost has pared down blog functionality to just the basics</li>
<li>Street cred: If you manage to get this all up and running you look awesome!</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons: </p>

<ul>
<li>Many free themes lack documentation, so you spend a lot of time tinkering to make things work</li>
<li>You have to host the blog yourself, or else pay Ghost (ie, the company behind Ghost) to host your blog</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I'm happy with my decision to use Ghost. I'll share the more technical details of how I did it in my next post.</p>

<p>Sidenote: I want to call out the current theme I'm using, <a href="https://github.com/Kikobeats/uno-zen">uno-zen</a>, and its creator, <a href="https://github.com/Kikobeats/uno-zen">Kiko Beats</a>. This was one of the best documented themes I found in the <a href="http://marketplace.ghost.org/themes/free/">Ghost marketplace</a>, which made setup much less of a headache than it could have been. I found a lot of free themes that provided almost no guidance, so it was refreshing to find an elegant theme that also had basic setup instructions.</p>]]></description><link>http://andysponring.com/about-ghost/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">eba4b6cd-2afa-40fa-8d10-07ea590ef8ed</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andy Sponring]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2015 16:09:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[My Journey to Hack Reactor]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://andysponring.com/content/images/2015/04/hrlogo.png" alt="My Journey to Hack Reactor"><p>I had been a product manager for about 5 years before I decided to take the plunge and do programming full time.</p>

<p>Why make the transition?</p>

<p>Quite simply, I love to code. While working as a product manager, my favorite part of the job was always the time I spent with my engineers, whether it was discussing specs, reviewing the work they did, or just conversing about the issues they faced and how they solved them.</p>

<p>Though I didn't start out with a formal CS degree, I built up my programming skills after work and on weekends. I started small with some online tutorials, then I took actual computer science classes. Last year, I decided to make engineering the focus of my career.</p>

<p>Coding bootcamps have been getting a <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/12/20/370954988/twelve-weeks-to-a-six-figure-job">lot of press</a> and seemed like a natural fit for me, since they put students through an accelerated course of study that is 100% focused on preparing them for the industry. <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a> has certainly distinguished itself as one of the <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/blog/industry-rankings-place-hack-reactor-as-top-school-in-the-world">best bootcamps out there</a>. </p>

<p>The program lasts 13 weeks, 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. At the end of the three months, graduates are fluent in full stack web development, but more importantly, have enough skills and experience to solve any technical problem that comes their way, and to master any new technology they need.</p>

<p>I'm just starting my 3rd week here and I'm loving it. I'll be updating this blog with my experiences, interesting tidbits I learn, challenges I overcome, and more stuff about myself. I hope you'll join me on this journey!</p>]]></description><link>http://andysponring.com/journey-to-hack-reactor/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">861f1d7e-a0d3-4be1-9de6-651a77f1a1a1</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andy Sponring]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2015 05:04:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Story Thus Far]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://andysponring.com/content/images/2015/04/Amazing-Austria---Imgur.jpg" alt="The Story Thus Far"><p>Hey everyone! My name is Andy and I’m a product manager turned software engineer. For the last 5 years I've worked at various startups in the Silicon Valley, mostly doing social and mobile games.</p>

<p>The next leg of my journey is a 12 week immersive program called <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor</a>. Staring March 23, I’ll be there 6 days a week for 12 hours a day, learning full-stack web development, algorithms, data structures, and a bunch of other fun, useful stuff. </p>

<p>Here’s my story in a few bullets:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bay Area native (grew up in Mountain View, CA)</li>
<li>Graduated UC Berkeley in 2007</li>
<li>Joined a startup called Playdom in 2008 as one of the first 10 employees</li>
<li>Playdom was acquired by Disney in 2010</li>
<li>Left Disney in 2012 and then worked for a couple startups</li>
<li>Got married to the love of my life just a few months ago!</li>
