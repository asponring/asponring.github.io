<p>Why make the transition?</p>

<p>The simple answer is that I simply love coding. While working as a product manager, my favorite part of the job was always the time I spent with my engineers, whether it was discussing specs, reviewing the work they did, or just conversing about the issues they faced and how they solved them.</p>

<p>Though I didn't start out with a formal CS degree, I built up my programming skills after work and on weekends. I started small with some online tutorials, then I took actual computer science classes. At last, I decided that engineering was where I wanted to take my career.</p>

<p>Coding bootcamps have been getting a <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/12/20/370954988/twelve-weeks-to-a-six-figure-job">lot of press</a> and seemed like a natural fit for me, since I wanted a job in industry but didn't have a formal CS degree. <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/blog/industry-rankings-place-hack-reactor-as-top-school-in-the-world">Hack Reactor</a> certainly has been distinguishing itself from the pack of coding schools, recently being ranked as one of the best coding bootcamps in the world. </p>]]></description><link>http://andysponring.com/journey-to-hack-reactor/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">861f1d7e-a0d3-4be1-9de6-651a77f1a1a1</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andy Sponring]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2015 05:04:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Story Thus Far]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://andysponring.com/content/images/2015/04/Amazing-Austria---Imgur.jpg" alt="The Story Thus Far"><p>Hey everyone! My name is Andy and I’m a product manager turned software engineer. For the last 5 years I've worked at various startups in the Silicon Valley, mostly doing social and mobile games.</p>

<p>The next leg of my journey is a 12 week immersive program called <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor</a>. Staring March 23, I’ll be there 6 days a week for 12 hours a day, learning full-stack web development, algorithms, data structures, and a bunch of other fun, useful stuff. </p>

<p>Here’s my story in a few bullets:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bay Area native (grew up in Mountain View, CA)</li>
<li>Graduated UC Berkeley in 2007</li>
<li>Joined a startup called Playdom in 2008 as one of the first 10 employees</li>
<li>Playdom was acquired by Disney in 2010</li>
<li>Left Disney in 2012 and then worked for a couple startups</li>
<li>Got married to the love of my life just a few months ago!</li>
