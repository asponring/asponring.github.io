      <p>The stat that <a href="http://qr.ae/LZ55P">Hack Reactor accepts only about 1 in 30 applicants</a> is still true, and now that I'm here I've seen how many technical interviews end unfavorably for candidates. Athough there are already numerous posts out there about the Hack Reactor admissions process, I thought I'd add my personal story here in the hopes that it might help people decide whether to apply, and if so, how to prepare.</p>

<p>Note: this all occured in November of 2014, and HR constantly iterates on their admissions process, so anything I write here could soon be outdated.</p>

<p>The first step of applying was solving a very basic coding challenge on the Hack Reactor website. I won't go into specifics, but it is so simple that even with no prior knowledge of JavaScript syntax, you should be able to crank out an answer after a couple minutes of Googling.</p>

<p>Immediately after completing this challenge, I was invited to sign up for a technical interview. The interview could take place in person or over Skype. Since I was already living in San Francisco, I opted for in person. Scheduling your interview is a self-service process, involving Google Calendar. I secured a spot a week and a half away.</p>

<p>A few things surprised me about the interview. Firstly, there seemed to be a low bar to getting the interview (just that basic admissions challenge). But perhaps that challenge proves effective at weeding out the majority of candidates who aren't really serious about applying. </p>

<p>The next surprised came when I reached Hack Reactor for my interview. Rather than happening in a private office, my interview was conducted entirely in the open on the office floor. This was a shock, and I chalk it up to office space being a premium at HR. In any case, don't let it throw you off. Be prepared to tune out the noise of the surrounding office activity.</p>

<p>My biggest surprise of all, however, was that it was a purely technical interview. As a product manager, I had been used to conducting interviews that included a mix of both "soft" questions (personality, background, management style) and "hard" questions (analyzing data, discussing monetization tactics, etc). My interviewer was genuinely surprised when I opened by handing him my meticulously prepared resume. "We're not big on resumes," he explained, but gave it a courtesy glance anyway. No further questions about my background were asked, and we launched right away into coding.</p>

<p>My interviewer and I shared a workstation with only a text editor open. I can't say much about the tasks I was given, but suffice to say they were challenging and not beginner programming tasks. That said, it appears that candidates aren't expected to absolutely nail the challenges. What's more important is for the interviewer to see how you work through solving a difficult problem, how you communicate your ideas, and how well you work under pressure.</p>

<p>Of course, I didn't have the advantage of this perspective while in the interview, and came away unsure what the outcome would be. Although I had solved most of the challenges, a couple had stumped me. I got the good news a week and a half later and eagerly accepted.</p>

<p>Finally, for prospective applicants I want to call out 3 resources that were exceptionally helpful to me in applying. If you're coming in with no programming experience, these are a must:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript">Codecademy's Javascript Track</a> - an easy primer to the world of programming using JavaScript</li>
<li><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent Javascript</a> - <em>especially</em> chapters 1-5. Absolutely key to a deeper understanding of JS</li>
<li><a href="http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges/">Coderbyte challenges</a> - these are small challenges similar to the ones you'll get in your HR interview. Do as many of the easy challenges as you can and some of the medium. These types of problems are common interview questions in the industry as well</li>
